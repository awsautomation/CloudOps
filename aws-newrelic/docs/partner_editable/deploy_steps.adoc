=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: If you want to enroll existing AWS accounts into {partner-product-short-name}, ensure that your AWS accounts are enrolled in AWS Control Tower.

Your list of existing AWS accounts must be formatted as a comma-delimited string (for example, `account_id1,account_id2,account_id3`). 

. Sign in to your AWS Control Tower management account, and launch the AWS CloudFormation template using the following link:

** https://fwd.aws/zJYx9[Create AWS CloudFormation stack.]

. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template, and provide values for any parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details about each parameter, see the link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] section. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
