This procedure is a part of course that teaches you how to build a quickstart. If you haven't already, checkout the [_course introduction_](/contribute-to-quickstarts).

Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up your demo services. 

## Spin up demo services

Clone the lab repository from GitHub: 
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/build-a-quickstart-lab.git
``` 

Change to the demo directory, called _flashDB_.

```bash

cd build-a-quickstart-lab/flashDB

```

This directory contains code for two important services:

- A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.
- A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations

Execute the following command to run your services:

```Python
python simulator.py
```

Here, you run the simulator that generates mock traffic against your database. Once the simulator is up and running, you see the following output in your terminal:

```bash animate
python simulator.py
[output] Writing...
[output] try_send

```

Next, you use [newrelic_telemetry_sdk](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python) to send telemetry data from your flashDB service to New Relic.
