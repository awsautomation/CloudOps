This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/automate-workflows/diagnose-problems).

</Callout>

The Telco Lite architecture has eight, interconnected microservices:

![Acme Telco Lite's architecture](../../../images/telco-lite/acme.png)

In this procedure, you use our [`demo-deployer`](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer) to spin up this infrastructure.

## Set up your environment

Before you begin, follow the [Prerequisites guide](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md#prerequisites) from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. You can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment.

To summarize:

- Install Docker & pull the demo-deployer image locally
- Create a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider
- Download a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS)

Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite.

## Deploy Telco Lite

It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using `demo-deployer`. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment:

- [AWS Telco Lite Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/main/catalog/telco_lite/telcolite.aws.json)
- [Azure Telco Lite Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/main/catalog/telco_lite/telcolite.azure.json)
- [GCP Telco Lite Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/main/catalog/telco_lite/telcolite.gcp.json)

Follow the [Deployment guide](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md#deploy-your-services) in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for `<demo-url>`.

<Callout variant="tip">

Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour.

When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful:

<br />

After configuring your environment, you only needed two commands (and a bit of patience) to spin up all the Telco Lite services!
