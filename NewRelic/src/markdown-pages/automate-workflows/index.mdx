<Intro>

When building today's complex systems, you want an easy, predictable way to verify that your configuration is defined as expected. This concept, Observability as Code, is brought to life through a collection of New Relic-supported orchestration tools, including Pulumi, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and a command-line interface. These tools enable you to integrate New Relic into your existing workflows, easing adoption, accelerating deployment, and returning focus to your main job&mdash;getting stuff done.

In addition to the guides below, find more automation solutions in our [Developer Toolkit](https://newrelic.github.io/developer-toolkit/).
