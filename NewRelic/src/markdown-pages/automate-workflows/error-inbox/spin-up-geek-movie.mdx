This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to manage errors using Errors Inbox. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/automate-workflows/error-inbox).

</Callout>

Geek's Movie Shop is a web application that consists of several interconnected microservices:

- cart
- catalogue
- dispatch
- payment
- ratings
- shipping
- user

You've instrumented these services with New Relic to monitor their performance and gain full visibility across your stack.

Before you begin using Errors Inbox to proactively find and manage errors in your app, you need to spin up these services in a local docker network. To mimic the traffic of real users, you run a special service that automatically generates load.

## Set up your environment

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone the lab repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/error-inbox-lab-material.git
```

</Step>

<Step>

In your cloned repo, open _.env_ to customize your environment variables.

```txt
DOCKERHUB_USER=username
TAG=latest
CLUSTER_NAME=local
PUBLIC_URL=http://docker-for-desktop:8888

NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>
```

Replace `<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>` with your real [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher). Your services use this key to write telemetry data to New Relic.

</Step>

<Step>

From the root directory of your application, export these variables.

```bash
source .env
```

Now you're ready to run your app!

</Step>

<Step>

Build and run your application.

```bash animate
docker compose build
docker compose up

Once it's up and running, the loader generates traffic to your services.

Leave this running so you'll see your telemetry data in New Relic.
