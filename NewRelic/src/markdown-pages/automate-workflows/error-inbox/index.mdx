<Intro>

You're one of the developers of an eCommerce website called Geek's Movie Shop, and recently, you introduced some new features. Before you push your changes to production where all your users will have access to them, you want to discover as many errors as you can in your development environment. Then you can decide which ones to fix and which ones to ignore.

[Errors Inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/) is the perfect tool to help you do this.
