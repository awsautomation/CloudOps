<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to manage errors using Errors Inbox.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you're [running your application locally](/automate-workflows/error-inbox/spin-up-geek-movie) before starting this one.

</Callout>

With your app now running in a local development environment, your next goal is to set up Errors Inbox. With it, you can debug your application before you deploy it to production.

## Create a workload

To observe your application in Errors Inbox, you first create a [workload](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster/).

In a workload, you group specific apps and services that you want to monitor. The workload then provides an aggregated view of the health and activities of those apps and services.

<Steps>

<Step>

Sign in to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com).

</Step>

<Step>

In the top right corner, click **Create a workload**.

</Step>

<Step>

Name your workload "error-inbox-lab".

</Step>

<Step>

Under **Select entities**, click **Add** for each of the following services to include it in the workload:

- geek-shop-cart-service
- geek-shop-catalogue-service
- geek-shop-dispatch-service
- geek-shop-payment-service
- geek-shop-ratings-service
- geek-shop-shipping-service
- geek-shop-user-service

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Create a workload**.

![Create a workload with services](../../../images/error-inbox/create-a-service-workload.png)

This creates a workload with all the geek-shop services.

## View the Errors Inbox

Now that you've created a workload, view its Errors Inbox.

<Steps>

<Step>

From the top navigation bar on the homepage, select **Errors Inbox**.

![Navigate to Errors Inbox](../../../images/error-inbox/errors-inbox-ui.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Select Workload**, then **error-inbox-lab** from the dropdown.

![select a workload](../../../images/error-inbox/select-workload.png)

This shows you the error groups across your workload.

</Step>

</Steps>

Now that you have an Errors Inbox for your workload, you can proactively monitor the errors across your stack.

<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to track full stack errors using Errors Inbox. Now that you've set up Errors Inbox, it's time to [triage your errors](/automate-workflows/error-inbox/triage-errors).
