<Intro>

You know better than anyone what information is crucial to your business, and how best to visualize it. Sometimes, this means going beyond dashboards to creating your own app. With React and GraphQL, you can create custom views tailored to your business. These guides are designed to help you start building apps, and dive into our library of components. We also have a growing number of [open source apps](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects/?category=New%20Relic%20One%20Catalog) that you can use to get started. The rest is up to you.
