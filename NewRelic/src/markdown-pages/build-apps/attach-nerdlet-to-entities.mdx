<Intro>

One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the **Apps** page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an [entity](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) in your account.

In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities.

</Intro>

## Before you begin

If you haven't already:

- [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup/) for a New Relic account
- [Install and configure the New Relic One CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==)

<Tutorial>

<Project>

```json fileName=nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json
{
    "schemaType": "NERDLET",
    "id": "entity-nerdlet-nerdlet",
    "displayName": "EntityNerdletNerdlet",
    "description": ""
}
```

</Project>

## Create a Nerdpack

<Steps>

<Step>

Update your CLI:

```sh
nr1 update
```

</Step>

<Step>

Create a Nerdpack with the CLI:

```sh
nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet
```

This results in a Nerdpack, called `entity-nerdlet`, which consists of a launcher, called `entity-nerdlet-launcher`, and a Nerdlet, called `entity-nerdlet-nerdlet`.

</Step>

<Step>

[Serve](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/publish-deploy/serve/) your Nerdpack:

```sh
cd entity-nerdlet
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

</Step>

<Step>

Go to [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), and navigate to **Apps**:

![Navigate to Apps](../../images/build-an-app/nav-to-apps.png)

`?nerdpacks=local` is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic.

</Step>

<Step>

Under **Your apps**, click your launcher to view your New Relic application:

![Click entity-nerdlet launcher](../../images/build-an-app/entity-nerdlet.png)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Attach your Nerdlet to entities

You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities.

<Steps>

<Step>

From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open _nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json_. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities.

</Step>

<Step>

Add a `context` object with an `entities` array:

```json fileName=nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json
{
    "schemaType": "NERDLET",
    "id": "entity-nerdlet-nerdlet",
    "displayName": "EntityNerdletNerdlet",
    "description": "",
    "context": {
        "entities": [
        ]
    }
}
```

This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts.

</Step>

<Step>

Add an entity context:

```json fileName=nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json
{
    "schemaType": "NERDLET",
    "id": "entity-nerdlet-nerdlet",
    "displayName": "EntityNerdletNerdlet",
    "description": "",
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "domain": "APM",
                "type": "APPLICATION"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all _application_ entities in the _APM_ domain.

</Step>

<Step>

Go to **APM**:

![Navigate to APM](../../images/build-an-app/nav-to-apm.png)

Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the `?nerdpacks=local` query string.

</Step>

<Step>

Choose any of your applications:

![Navigate to APM application](../../images/build-an-app/nav-to-apm-service.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application:

![Your Nerdlet attached to the application views](../../images/build-an-app/nerdlet-attached-to-app.png)

Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Tutorial>

## Configure your `entities` context

The `context.entities` key in your Nerdlet's _nr1.json_ file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to.

### Specify an entity `domain`

Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the `domain` as one of the following values:

- `APM`: [Application Performance Monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/)
- `BROWSER`: [Browser](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/)
- `INFRA`: [Infrastructure monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/)
- `MOBILE`: [Mobile monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/)
- `SYNTH`: [Synthetic monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/)

For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the `APM` domain:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"domain": "APM"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to all entities _except_ those in a domain:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"domain": "!APM"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"domain": "APM"},
            {"domain": "BROWSER"}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Specify an entity `type`

Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the `type` as one of the following values:

- `APPLICATION`
- `HOST`
- `MONITOR`

For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the `APPLICATION` type:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"type": "APPLICATION"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to all entities _except_ those of a specified type:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"type": "!APPLICATION"}
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {"type": "APPLICATION"},
            {"type": "MONITOR"}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Specify entity `tags`

Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given [tag](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/).

For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "key": "guid",
                        "values": [
                            "<SOME ENTITY GUID>"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular `accountId` _and_ uses the Python programming language:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "key": "accountId",
                        "values": [
                            "<SOME ACCOUNT ID>"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "key": "language",
                        "values": [
                            "python"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Combine filters

When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine `domain`, `type`, and `tags`:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "entities": [
            {
                "domain": "APM",
                "type": "APPLICATION",
                "tags": [
                    {
                        "key": "language",
                        "values": [
                            "python"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "domain": "SYNTH",
                "type": "MONITOR"
            },
            {
                "domain": "BROWSER"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to:

- All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the `python` language
- **AND** all Synthetic monitors
- **AND** all Browser entities
