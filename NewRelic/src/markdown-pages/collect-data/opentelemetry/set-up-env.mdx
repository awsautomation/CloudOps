<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to instrument your application with OpenTelemetry. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/collect-data/opentelemetry).

</Callout>

Before you can walk through the lab proper, you need to set up your development environment. Here, you:

1. Spin up your .NET application
2. Send traffic to your app with a simple load generator

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone the lab repository:

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/opentelemetry-dotnet-lab-materials
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Restore dependencies, build, and run the application:

<>

```bash
cd opentelemetry-dotnet-lab-materials
dotnet restore app
dotnet build app
dotnet run --project app
```

</>

In the output, you see a url for your app:

<>

</>

The application has a single endpoint at `/WeatherForcast`, which you can visit in your browser or with curl:

<>

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:7072/WeatherForecast
[output] [{"date":"2021-11-18T16:03:02.655159-05:00","temperatureC":38,"temperatureF":100,"summary":"Chilly"},{"date":"2021-11-19T16:03:02.655161-05:00","temperatureC":-3,"temperatureF":27,"summary":"Mild"},{"date":"2021-11-20T16:03:02.655162-05:00","temperatureC":-8,"temperatureF":18,"summary":"Hot"},{"date":"2021-11-21T16:03:02.655162-05:00","temperatureC":3,"temperatureF":37,"summary":"Cool"},{"date":"2021-11-22T16:03:02.655162-05:00","temperatureC":10,"temperatureF":49,"summary":"Warm"}]
```

</>

<Callout variant="tip" title="Technical Detail">

You use the `-k` option to instruct curl to not verify the site's SSL certification. This is fine because you're making a request against localhost.

</Callout>

Leave this open so you can simulate requests against it.

</Step>

<Step>

In another terminal window, run the load generator:

<>

```bash
cd opentelemetry-dotnet-lab-materials/sim
pip install requests
python simulator.py
```

</>

</Step>

</Steps>

Now that you've got your application and load generator running, it's time to see what OpenTelemetry's all about.
