This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to troubleshoot your web app with New Relic browser.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [_Set up your lab environment_](/collect-data/browser/set-up-env), before starting this one.

Your React app is now up and running in the browser. You want to make sure your users always have the best experience on your site. For that, you need insights into your users' experiences, such as their page load times.

To achieve this goal, you need to install our browser agent.

## Install browser agent

<Steps>

<Step>

Navigate to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/), and sign in with your account.

</Step>

<Step>

On the right side of the upper navigation bar, click **Add data**.

</Step>

<Step>

Scroll down to **Browser & mobile** and select **Browser monitoring**.

![Arrow pointing to New Relic Browser](../../../images/nr-browser/newrelic-browser.png)

This opens **Get Started with New Relic Browser**, which guides you through installing our browser agent.

</Step>

<Step>

From **Get Started with New Relic Browser**, select **Copy/Paste Javascript code** for your deployment method.

</Step>

<Step>

Scroll down to **Name your app**, select **No. (Name your standalone app)**, name your app **Relicstaurants**, and click **Enable**.

![enable browser agent for your app](../../../images/nr-browser/enable-browser.png)

This gives you a JavaScript code snippet to enable browser monitoring. Copy it to your clipboard.

<Step>

Open your app in the IDE of your choice. 

In _public/index.html_ file of your app, paste the copied javascript snippet inside the `<head>`.

<>

```html lineHighlight=22-23 fileName=public/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />

</head>

<body>

  <div id="root"></div>
</body>

</html>

```

</>

Your application is now instrumented with our browser agent.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Restart your application

Now that you've instrumented your application, it's time to restart your local server.

<>

```bash
npm run build
npm run newstart
```

</>

Restart your load generator, as well.

<>

```bash
python3 simulator.py
```
