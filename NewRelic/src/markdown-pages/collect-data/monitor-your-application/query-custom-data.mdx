<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to get started with New Relic to monitor your application.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [_Collect custom business data_](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/collect-custom-data), before starting this one.

</Callout>

With your app recording custom business data, you're now ready to get insights from your data. Particularly, you look up:

- Orders from the past 24 hours
- Most popular restaurants
- Average order amount
- Most popular items

In this procedure, you create a dashboard, query your custom data, gather it in charts, and add those charts to your dashboard to have quick view into these data points.
