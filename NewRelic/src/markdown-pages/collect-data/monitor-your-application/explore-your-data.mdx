<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to get started with New Relic to monitor your application.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you'v instrumented your application with our [APM](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/install-apm) and [browser](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/install-browser-agent) agents, before starting this one.

</Callout>

With your app reporting data to New Relic, you now have insights into your app.But you want to understand the collected data better. For example, you want to know how many users are active on your site. For that, you explore your data using [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/), New Relic's query language; gather it; and visualize it in interactive charts.

In this procedure, you explore your data in New Relic. Specifically, you:

- View your page views
- Count active sessions
- View your transactions
- Count total transactions
- View your slowest transactions
- Count your transactions with different response codes

## Query your data

Use NRQL to explore and retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insights into your application.

<Callout variant='tip'>

NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. Read our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to know more about what it is and when to use it.

### View your pageviews

<Steps>

<Step>

Navigate to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/) and sign in with your account. From the left navigation bar, click **Query builder**.

![Arrow pointing to Query your data](../../../images/foodme/query-your-data.png)

This opens an interactive **Query builder** to explore your data.

</Step>

<Step>

Here, execute the following query to view `PageView` records for your app.

<>

```sql
SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE appName='Relicstraunts'
```

</>

Click **Run** to see results.

![view all your pageviews](../../../images/foodme/view-pageviews.png)

Here, you observe all the pageviews for your app.

### Count active sessions

Use the following query to count your active sessions.

<>

```sql
FROM PageView SELECT count(session) WHERE appName='Relicstraunts'
```

</>

Here, you see the number of active sessions.

![count active sessions](../../../images/foodme/active-sessions.png)

### View your transactions

Use the following query to view all your transactions.

<>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Transaction WHERE appName='Relicstraunts'
```

</>

Here, you see all your transactions for Relicstraunts app.

![view all your transactions](../../../images/foodme/view-transactions.png)

### Count total transactions

Use the following query to count your total transactions.

<>

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='Relicstraunts'
```

</>

Here, you see the total number of transactions for your Relicstraunts app.

![count total transactions](../../../images/foodme/count-all-transactions.png)

### View slowest transactions

Execute the following query to view your slowest transactions.

<>

```sql
SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Where appName='Relicstraunts' FACET name
```

</>

Here, you see your slowest transactions.

![view your slowest transactions](../../../images/foodme/slowest-transactions.png)

The chart is hard to see in this format. You can choose to present your results in different formats such as bar, table, or pie chart.

Change the chart type to **Pie**.

![change chart type](../../../images/foodme/chart-types.png)

Now, you see your slowest transaction in the form of a pie chart.

![slowest transactions in pie chart](../../../images/foodme/slow-transactions-pie.png)

### Count your transactions with different response codes

Use the following query to view all your transactions with different response codes.

<>

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='Relicstraunts' AND http.statusCode!='200' FACET http.statusCode
```

</>

![transactions with different response codes](../../../images/foodme/transactions-with-different-response-code.png)

</Step>

</Steps>

You've now seen your application's performance data. Next, you collect custom business data from your application with New Relic.

<Callout variant='lab'>

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to get started with New Relic to monitor your application. Now that you've explored your application's performance related data, [collect custom business data from your application](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/collect-custom-data).
