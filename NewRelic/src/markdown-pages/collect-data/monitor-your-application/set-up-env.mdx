<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to get started with New Relic to monitor your application. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/collect-data/monitor-your-application).

</Callout>

Before you can walk through the lab, you need to spin up your React application.

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone the lab repository.

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/relicstaurants.git
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to the root directory of your application and switch to the lab directory.

<>

```bash
cd relicstaurants
git switch nr-basics-lab-material
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Next, install dependencies, and run the application.

<>

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run newstart
```

</>

This opens your Relicstaurants application in your browser.

![relicstaurants homepage](../../../images/foodme/homepage.png)

Enter your delivery address and search to get started.

![nearby restaurant list](../../../images/foodme/restaurant-list.png)

Here, you see a list of restaurants where you can order food.

</Step>

<Step>

Choose a restaurant.

![choose a restaurant](../../../images/foodme/choose-restaurant.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Select an item or two, and click on the cart in the upper right corner.

![select food](../../../images/foodme/select-food.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Click **PAY**.

![checkout](../../../images/foodme/checkout.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Enter a fake card information and click **Finish payment** to place the order.

![purchase](../../../images/foodme/purchase.png)

Next, you use a simulator to generate more traffic to your application.

</Step>

<Step>

In another terminal window, navigate to the root directory of your application, and run the load generator.

<>

```bash
# Navigate to the root directiory of your application
cd relicstaurants/simulator
[output]
# Switch to lab branch
git switch nr-basics-lab-material
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
[output]
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
[output]
# Install the simulator's dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
[output]
# Run the simulator
python simulator.py
[output] ====== WebDriver manager ======
[output] Current google-chrome version is 99.0.4844
[output] Get LATEST chromedriver version for 99.0.4844 google-chrome
```

</>

<Callout variant='important'>

This load generator assumes you have Google Chrome installed on your computer. If you're using a different browser, either skip this step and generate traffic manually, or [install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/).

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

Now, that you know how to run your application, it's time to instrument it. In the terminal windows that are running your application and simulator, press `<CTRL-C>` to shut them down. With your app shut down, you'll be able to update your code to introduce monitoring tools.

<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to get started with New Relic to monitor your application. Now that you've set up your environment, [instrument your application with APM agent](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/install-apm).
