The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start allows you to scale the observability
of your AWS Control Tower managed landing zones with New Relic, right from the moment accounts are enrolled. You spend no time managing New Relic integration while automatically monitoring your AWS enviornment from New Relic.

{partner-product-short-name} requires that you grant read permission to operational telemetry data from your AWS account. To do this, use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html[IAM cross-account access^]. {partner-product-short-name} uses the Amazon CloudWatch API to collect telemetry data for your monitored AWS services. For more information, see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/integrations-managed-policies[Integrations and managed policies^].
